00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:39.416
<v Sasi Rekha T>Your level managers.</v>

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:31.326

<v Sasi Rekha T>User story.</v>

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:56.436
<v Sasi Rekha T>And this is the story point and I can have this story point like 1 to 10.</v>

00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:02.656
<v Sasi Rekha T>It is based on the wall volume of this particular functionality.</v>

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:06.636
<v Sasi Rekha T>If it is easy, it is based on our team.</v>

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:33.796
<v Sasi Rekha T>Uh, yeah, it we'll be discussing with the team whether we are going to have this as a this point is 1 to 10 if it is easy and for example if it is going to if all the function it is easy and it is if it is going to complete within 4 hours that will be the that story point for that part specific functionality will be one and based on that the story points volume will be increased.</v>

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:37.916
<v Sasi Rekha T>So this is I feel this is an easy one so I'm giving this as a one.</v>
